He ended up playing for the Suns, as well as Orlando, the Washington Wizards and Los Angeles Clippers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gortat averaged career highs in points (13.3) and rebounds (9.3) with the Suns, who acquired Gortat in a trade with the Magic during the 2010-11 season and traded him to the Wizards right before the 2013-14 season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one from Phoenix’s 2012-13 team is still on&nbsp;the Suns, and Gortat is currently a free agent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gortat’s comments came after Green basically said no one, including the media covering the Suns, blames the Suns organization for&nbsp;Chriss, a first-round pick,&nbsp;underachieving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“No Phoenix writer is going to bash the Phoenix Suns,” Green said. “So, let’s be frank about it. When he was there, the organization was terrible. Everything was going wrong. But he gets blamed like he’s the problem. When he left, nothing was going right. So, that’s my take on it. It’s that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chriss made NBA all-rookie second team in 2017 with the Suns, but he was traded to Houston before the start of last season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then he was moved to Cleveland before winding up at Golden State.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“No one ever blames these s&#8212;-y franchises,&#8221; Green said. &#8220;They always just want to blame the kid. It’s not always the kid’s fault. He’s getting older now, so he’s not a kid anymore. But he came into this organization as a kid. But it’s never the organization’s fault. It’s always the fault of that guy. So, I’m happy he’s gotten an opportunity to show what he can really do.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warren took aim at the Suns for shipping him after averaging 14.4 points in five seasons with the franchise. Warren was injury-prone, but put up numbers in Phoenix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m ready to show the whole NBA — and not just the Suns for making the wrong decision — that the Pacers made the right decision,&#8221; Warren said. &#8220;I’m worth more than cash considerations. It’s on me to prove it. But the Suns messed up.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c25143e1-cc4f-412c-bee9-552ed9338402-AP19285540509558.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21\" srcset=\"http://http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c25143e1-cc4f-412c-bee9-552ed9338402-AP19285540509558.jpg 540w, http://http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c25143e1-cc4f-412c-bee9-552ed9338402-AP19285540509558-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Indiana Pacers forward T.J.

They’re coming off their second-worst record in franchise history and&nbsp;haven’t made the playoffs since 2010. New head coach Monty Williams is leading the charge to fix the Suns’ image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He’s trying to create a culture here for positivity so that we can get better and we can grow,” said Frank Kaminsky III, whom the Suns signed in the offseason. “We can progress as the season goes along so we can get better and better and we can start to improve and hopefully change the way the Suns are viewed around the league. I think that’s our biggest goal. I know that’s what he wants.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Suns open the season Wednesday against Sacramento.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So he’s trying to create that culture of communication and positivity of players and coaches holding each other responsible and accountable for everything,” Kaminsky added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have opinion about current state of the&nbsp;Suns?
